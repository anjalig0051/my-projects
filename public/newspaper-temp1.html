    <section>
    <blockquote align="justify">Following the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 and its commencement of lunar studies, ISRO is now embarking on an exploration mission to investigate the Sun's surface. ISRO has launched the PSLV Rocket from SriHarikota, Andhrs Pradesh, India at 11.50 am on 2nd September, 2023. The rocket will reach the Lagrange point L1 after about four months and will conduct its study from this point.
    In Hindi, "Aditya" is synonymous with the sun. On September 2 at 11:50 a.m., the launch of Aditya L1 is scheduled from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The primary objective of the Aditya L1 mission is to scrutinize the sun's surface and gather valuable data to enhance our understanding of solar phenomena.

    <p align="justify" class="main-para">ISRO's Aditya L1 India's Solar Mission -
        Aditya L1 is India's first solar mission. Developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Aditya L1 spacecraft will carry 7 instruments to study the Sun's atmosphere. The mission is scheduled to launch on Saturday, September 2,  2023 at 11.50 am.
                About Aditya L1
                Aditya L1 will serve as India's first space mission dedicated to examining the Sun. Positioned within a halo orbit encircling Lagrange point 1 (L1) in the Sun-Earth system, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, this spacecraft offers a distinct advantage by maintaining an uninterrupted view of the Sun, free from any eclipses. This unique vantage point enables real-time observations of solar activities and their influence on space weather.
                The spacecraft carries a complement of seven payloads, each designed to scrutinize various aspects of the Sun, including the photosphere, chromosphere, and the outermost layer, known as the corona, using a combination of electromagnetic, particle, and magnetic field detectors. 
                Positioned at the L1 point, four of these payloads have direct sightlines to the Sun, while the remaining three conduct in-situ investigations of particles and fields at Lagrange point L1. This invaluable research allows for a deeper understanding of the propagation of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium.
             Significance of Aditya L1<br>
             The Aditya L1 payloads are expected to yield crucial insights into several phenomena of the solar giant SUN, such as coronal heating, coronal mass ejections, pre-flare and flare activities, space weather dynamics, and the propagation of particles and fields. These findings will significantly contribute to our understanding of these complex solar processes.Aditya L1 will serve as India's first space mission dedicated to examining the Sun.
